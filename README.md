# Video To Audio Converter

In this project, we'll learn how to extract audio files from videos using python. 

Before I found working Python code for this project, I thought it would be easy to find working examples. 

If I don't know how to use Python or other programming languages. I would repeatedly separate audio files, open videos, and wait for software to separate audio clips and video clips. 

Then, I just have to compile audio files and wait a long time, needlessly. 

But I wouldn't be doing that. With the power of programming, we don't need to repeat what we already know.
